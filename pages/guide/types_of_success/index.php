						              <p class="main-section-block-title">Understanding Progress</p>
						              <p class="">Progress is a cumulative measure of unfinished goals your pursuing or tasks that arenâ€™t complete. Progress is built from activities you perform over time. When you visit the Reputation Center, activities are tallied up to assess and visualize your progress since your last visit. Of all possible activities, some are usually more valuable to you than others.</p>

									  <p class="main-section-block-title">Understanding Status</p>
									  <p class="">Status is a &quot;point-in-time&quot; identifier of completed achievements. They are often used to delegate privilege, coveted position, or special access. The closest real-world example are airline loyalty programs, but that is merely one possibility. They are often tied with tangible benefits.</p>

									  <p class="main-section-block-title">Understanding Recognition</p>
									  <p class="">Recognition relates to your publically surfaced, positive moments and the communities reaction to them. Throughout the program, there opportunities for everyone to learn what worked, what didn&#39;t, and how to use that knowledge effectively. Don&#39;t worry, your privacy is of the utmost concern. Negatively reflective actions aren&#39;t usually shared, but the decision to do so is up to your particular program team.  If there are concerns, please contact your program manager.</p>
