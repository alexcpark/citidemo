									  <p>Employee lifestyles are changing rapidly. New challenges, opportunities, and resources exist that push people beyond what&apos;s historically been possible. Our tools should meet those needs and help make that journey easier. Enter: The Employee Journey of the Future. At Citi, It is largely comprised of 8 key areas (first shown)&colon;</p>

						              <p class="main-section-block-break">The eight above steps capture the challenge as presented by Citi. Badgeville&apos;s <span class="bv-bold">Enterprise Gamification Platform</span> and <span class="bv-bold">Reputation Center</span> are the solution.</p>
						              <p class="main-section-block-title">Why Badgeville?</p>
									  <p class="">Badgeville&apos;s gamification platform, along with its first in class Reputation Center (with a targeted design), tackle six of the eight challenges above. Why only six? Why not tackle all eight? Please note the middle section of the diagram above (inside the light purple boxes). This section captures what Badgeville defines as the &quot;<span class="bv-bold">employee growth loop</span>&quot; and is our design focus.</p>
									  <p class="">The growth loop is an important part of the employee journey and captures the activities an employee does every day. When targeted and gamified, these activities help us improve. At its core, <span class="bv-bold">gamification through Badgeville</span> does just that but with precision, personal relevance, and results. While all eight areas are important, these central five (plus one additional in onboarding) are the six areas most commonly responsible for a positive professional experience and ongoing employee success.</p>
									  <p class="">Badgeville&apos;s powerful platform and the provided targeted design helps us address these areas directly and with measurable impact.</p>
									  <p class="">Take charge, define a path, and plant the seeds for your employees&apos; success.</p>
