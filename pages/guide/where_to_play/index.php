									  <p class="main-section-block-title">First, How do I use Badgeville?</p>
						              <p class="">Badgeville is a gamified layer added to your applications and workflows. As a service, we provide a host of resources to help you design, deploy, and maintain a successful program ontop of your current digital workflow. At it&apos;s core, you gain access to&colon;</p>
									  <ul class="main-section-block-list2">
						              	<li>A <span class="bv-bold">cloud-based engine</span> to power the experience.</li>
						              	<li><span class="bv-bold">Design expertise</span> to structure your program.</li>
						              	<li><span class="bv-bold">Visualizations</span> to integrate into your existing application and provide feedback.</li>
						              </ul>
									  <p class="main-section-block-break2">Therefore, &quot;playing&quot; with Badgeville or &quot;using&quot; our service means that gamified screens or <span class="bv-bold">visualizations</span> are added to your current applications and accessed in two ways, either: 1) directly, as integrated feature of your existing internal tools or 2) externally as separate web app. In the end, all that matters is what works best for your timelines and available tool sets.</p>
									  <p class="main-section-block-title">What does that mean for this challenge?</p>
									  <p class="main-section-block-break2">Well, In lieu of getting access to an official Citi application, we did the next best thing&colon; we built our own! Introducing &quot;<span class="bv-bold">Citi Net</span>,&quot; a mock intranet created by Badgeville to power your demo experience. In it, employee &quot;tasks&quot; are emulated. From there, you can perform these activities live and then see your results in your personal Reputation Center (an external collection of visualizations). You can also see results inside some applications natively. These applications allow for direct embedding of our smaller widget-style visualizations (i.e. Sharepoint and Salesforce). </p>
									  <p class="main-section-block-title">Where do I start?</p>
									  <p class="">Citi Net and the Reputation center are your first stops for gamification. Here&apos;s a full description of each asset provided with this demo&colon;</p>
									  <ul class="main-section-block-list">
									  	<li><span class="bv-bold">Sharepoint (as the mock intranet, &quot;Citi Net&quot;)</span> - Location for learning and onboarding content. Includes visualizations.</li>
									  	<li><span class="bv-bold">Salesforce</span> - A location for employee performance &amp; sales activity. Includes visualizations.</li>
									  	<li><span class="bv-bold">Yammer</span> - A location for social collaboration and knowledge sharing.</li>
									  	<li><span class="bv-bold">The Reputation Center</span> - A modern interface for aggregating all visualizations across programs.</li>
									  </ul>
									  <p class="">The four items above illustrate the power of Badgeville&apos;s platform to aggregate your employee gamification into one personalized experience. Sharepoint, Yammer, and Salesforce are just three platforms that we can integrate with. Contact your representative today for a complete list of our current offerings.</p>
